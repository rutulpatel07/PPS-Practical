#include <stdio.h>
void main()
{
    int i =-4, j, num = 10;
    j = i %-3;
    j = (j ? 0:num * num);
    printf("j=%d", j);
}

// Output: j=100
// Explanation:
// The code snippet declares an integer variable i and j and initializes i with -4 and num with 10.
// The expression i % -3 is evaluated and stored in j. The value of i is -4 and the value of -3 is -3. The remainder of -4 divided by -3 is -1. So, j = -1.
// The ternary operator is used to check if j is true or false. If j is true, then the value of j is 0; otherwise, the value of j is num * num.
// In this case, j is not equal to 0, so the value of j is num * num, which is 10 * 10 = 100.
